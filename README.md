## Scripts and Procedure
The script makes a join between the GDBs of yesterday and today. The join is based on the geometries, which must be strictly identical to be joined.
In recap.CSV, there is a summary of changes between the two dates:
* previous_date: yesterday
* new_date: today
* sum_ESID_diff: number of ESIDs that differ
* sum_LABEL_diff: number of different adress labels
* sum_previous_ESID: the number of geometries/streets/adresses that only exist in the previous_date GDB
* sum_new_ESID: the number of geometries/streets/adresses that only exist in the new_date GDB

Vector results in data folder:
* YYYY-MM-DD_duplicate.gpkg: geometries duplicated in the original GDBs. Only one geometry per duplicate is kept for further analysis.
* YYYY-MM-DD_YYYY-MM-DD_previous.gpkg: geometries/streets/adresses that exist only in the previous_date GDB.
* YYYY-MM-DD_YYYY-MM-DD_new.gpkg: geometries/streets/addresses that only exist in the new_date GDB.
